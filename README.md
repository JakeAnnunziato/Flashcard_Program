# dsa-flashcards

Python terminal program containing flashcards for data structures &amp; algorithms.

This program has a very advanced quiz function which will be used as the basis for the project.

From here, I would love to add a study mode to go along with this.  It doesnt have to be anything big

just another way for the user to learn the cards without only having to do the quiz.  By the end of this project

the user will have multiple ways to study and prepare for the test. 


Tasks

            Preliminary
- [ ] study the code to understand the process
- [ ] test code and make sure everything works
- [ ] fix any bugs on the project

            Study Mode
- [ ] next go online and find multiple different code examples to use for the study mode
- [ ] pick the best one
- [ ] begin to add in code but test the code to make sure it works periodically
- [ ] by week two I should have the basics down for the study mode and will begin to work in more detail, shortly after
