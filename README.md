# dsa-flashcards
Python terminal program containing flashcards for data structures &amp; algorithms.  
This program will allow users to be able to study for their tests effectively.  
This already has a quiz component to it; however, I would like to be able to add a study aspect as well by adding onto the code

Prelimary tasks

-[ ] check code for any bugs and make sure it runs properly
-[ ] find code online that could be used as a baseline for the study mode
-[ ] find out best way to add study mode 

Actual tasks

-[ ] use online code to help build study mode
-[ ] periodically test code to make sure that the project doesnt break
-[ ] have beginning code for the study mode by end of the week
